# Video Game Sales Analysis (Data Analytics Project)
##  Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze global video game sales data to uncover trends in game popularity, regional performance, genre success, and sales growth over time. The insights derived help understand market behavior and factors influencing video game sales.

## Dataset

The dataset contains historical video game sales records including:
-Game Title
-Platform
-Genre
-Publisher
-Release Year
-Regional Sales (National/NA, EU, JP, etc.)
-Global Sales
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of how different types of games perform across various regions.

## Tools & Technologies Used

-Python
-Pandas (Data Cleaning & Analysis)
-Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)\
-SQL (Data querying and filtering)
-Excel (Initial data exploration)\
-Power BI (Interactive dashboard & reporting)

## Analysis Performed

-Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicates)
-Genre-wise sales analysis
-Region-wise performance comparison
-Country-level sales distribution
-Year-wise sales trend analysis
-Global vs National sales comparison
-Top-selling games and platforms identification
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations

## Key Business Insights

-Action and Sports genres dominate global video game sales.
-Certain regions contribute significantly more to global revenue than others.
-Video game sales experienced peak growth during specific years, indicating industry boom periods.
-Some platforms consistently produce higher-selling games compared to others.
-Global sales trends closely follow regional performance patterns.

## Dashboard & Visualizations

The project includes interactive dashboards built in Power BI to visualize:
-Sales trends over time
-Genre performance
-Regional and country sales distribution
-Platform-wise contribution to global sales
